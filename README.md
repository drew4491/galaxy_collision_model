## Galaxy Collision
All the code files are explained in the bottom of the PDF. (What they're used for) <br/>

The two files here include modeling the collision of two galaxies, and modeling the Schroedinger Wave Equation. <br/>

The two galaxies colliding are modeled with different rotations to show how each affects the outcome. <br/>

There are technically 4 different scenarios but only 3 are done as there are 2 that are the same process: <br/>

Galaxy 1 rotating clockwise and Galaxy 2 rotating clockwise <br/>

Galaxy 1 rotating counter-clockwise and Galaxy 2 rotating Clockwise and vice versa. This is shown in 1 video as the interpretation for the other case will show similar results. <br/>

Galaxy 1 rotating clockwise and Galaxy 2 rotating counter-clockwise <br/>
