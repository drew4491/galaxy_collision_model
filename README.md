## Galaxy Collision
More simulations/models from a more advanced computational physics class. <br/>

The two files here include modeling the collision of two galaxies, and modeling the Schroedinger Wave Equation. <br/>

The two galaxies colliding are modeled with different rotations to show how each affects the outcome. <br/>

There are technically 4 different scenarios: <br/>

Galaxy 1 rotating clockwise and Galaxy 2 rotating clockwise <br/>

Galaxy 1 rotating counter-clockwise and Galaxy 2 rotating Clockwise and vice versa. This is shown in 1 video as the interpretation for the other case will show similar results. <br/>

Galaxy 1 rotating clockwise and Galaxy 2 rotating counter-clockwise <br/>

## Schrödinger Wave Equation

The Schrödinger Wave simulation is shown with a potential well, potential wall, and also models the double-slit experiment. For this, we had to manipulate the input values, or initial conditions, to see how the model was affected. If the initial conditions / boundary conditions didn't make sense, the output also did not make any sense typically having the wave function just spread out into nothing with no real interpretation being gathered from it. If the conditions were right, it is possible to see how the potential well and potential wall contain or reflect the waveform.  The double-slit experiment shows how the wave function passes through the two slits and behaves like a wave/particle with the well known quantum mechanical pattern demonstrated after passing through the slits.
